## PGDIPS: Physics-guided deep image prior for stain deconvolution

Pytorch implementation for the manuscript "Physics-guided Deep Learning Enables Generalized Stain Deconvolution of Histopathology Images"

### Known issues with the current version
The concentration maps are rotated 90 degrees likely due to we recently switched to skimage.io.imread(). However the reconstructed image and the deconvolution process is not affected. 
We are working on a fix. For a temporary solution, please uncomment line 103 and comment line 104-105 in pgdips.py.

### Installation

Install [anaconda/miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
Required packages

```
  $ conda env create --name pgdip --file environment.yml
  $ conda activate pgdip
```

> Please check if your graphics card is compatible with the following the packages: cudatoolkit=11.3.1 and pytorch 1.11.0. If your gpu will not support this, you can downgrade pytorch, cuda and cudnn.

## Training on provided images

> Train PGDIPS on provided target images:

```
  $ python pgdips.py config=he.cfg
```

> Switch between different types of stained images, use option:

```
[--config]      # he.cfg, ihc.cfg, alcianblue.cfg, DeepLIIF6.cfg, fibronectin.cfg, SMACD34.cfg, trichrome.cfg
```

## Training on your own data by creating a configuration file

1. Place patch files as `input\[image_name]`. Supported formats are `.jpg, .png, .tiff and .tif`.

2. Create a configuration file for your own data based on the following template and save it as `config\[config_name]`.

```
[system]
input = [image_name]
input_folder = ./input
output_folder = ./output

[preprocess]
input_depth = 3 
input_size = 512 # 256, 512, 1024, etc
roi_selection = centercrop #centercrop, crop, resize
x_coor_start = 1 # only applicable when roi_selection is crop
y_coor_start = 1 # only applicable when roi_selection is crop

[stain]
num_stains = 2 # or 3 
fixed_color = False
default_stain_vector_1 = 0.60, 0.75, 0.29 # no need to change these
default_stain_vector_2 = 0.21, 0.91, 0.36 # no need to change these
use_spectral_correction_factor = False # True or False, whether to use the spectral correction factor

[network]
iterations = 6000
keep_color_iterations = 2000 # how long are the stain vectors regulated by the default stain vectors
init_learning_rate = 0.0005
plot_during_training = True # save intermediate plots?
show_every = 400 # save intermediate plots how often? 

[loss]
weight_l1 = 1
weight_exclusion = 0.3 # increase this if concentration maps overlap and decrease this when one or more c-maps are empty
weight_mse = 1
```

> The primary criteria for selecting ROI is to make sure that the ROI contains enough (and ideally relatively equal amount of) concentrations of all the target stains.
>
> Centercrop is the default option. 
>
> Resize is not recommended as it changes the spectral bias (i.e. deep image prior) of the image and may require chaning the network structure.
>
> Input size determines runtime and VRAM bottleneck. A GPU with less than 6 GB VRAM can handle input size of 1024 but 512 is recommended.

3. Train a PGDIPS model.

```
$ python pgdips.py --config=[config_name]
```

## What can I do if I am not happy with PGDIPS deconvolution results?
1. Double check the quality of input image: Please double check the preprocessed (cropped) image for stain deconvolution, which is stored in the output folder. PGDIPS usually works well, except for two cases, 1) when the colors of two stains are too similiar 2) when the distribution of two stains are too imbalanced (for example when there are too much hematoxylin and too few DAB stain in the input image).

2. Run PGDIPS again with parameters learned from the first run: After running PGDIPS the physics parameters such as stain color vectors and background correction factors are saved in the output folder. Running PGDIPS again using these parameters (for example by setting default color vectors 1 and 2 equals the estimated color vectors from pervious rounds) will help improve the assignment of structures to correct colors, as the model will start from correct colors at the beginning of training. 

3. Tune the weights of different loss functions: We found that weight_l1=1 and weight_mse=1 works in all our experiments. weight_exclusion can have a big impact on the estimated concentration maps. If one of the concentration maps is too blurry or empty, try tuning weight_exclusion down. 

4. Rerun PGDIPS: As the input of DIP modules are random noise, when the initialization of the random noise went wrong, the concentration maps may contains black hole artifacts. This is very rare and can usually solved by running PGDIPS again with another random seed.
